parent.appendChild(el) → add as last child

parent.insertBefore(el, ref) → insert before reference

parent.prepend(el) → add as first child

el.before(newEl), el.after(newEl), el.replaceWith(newEl) → relative insertions

answer to the question no-03
An event (like click) occurs on an element.

The browser first runs the event handler on the target element.

Then it goes up to the parent, then the grandparent, and so on, until it reaches document (and window).

Each ancestor’s event listeners for that event get a chance to run.
